## Testing

### Validator Testing

- The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) services were used to validate all pages of the project in order to ensure there were no syntax errors.

#### Validation Errors
**HTML**
  - The validator found that I had missing quotation marks in my options buttons that threw up multiple errors. This was located and fixed. The validator now shows no errors.
  ![HTML validator code clear](assets/readme-images/html-validator.png)
**CSS**
  - The validator found one error with my CSS where I had a stray semicolon. 
  ![CSS validator code error](assets/readme-images/css-validator-error.png)
  This was located and deleted. The validator now shows no errors.
  ![CSS validator code clear](assets/readme-images/css-validator.png)
**Javascript**
  - The validator gave one warning. 
  ![Javascript validator code warning](assets/readme-images/javascript-validator-warning.png)
  - This was fixed by altering the event listeners to not reference outer scope variable by adding new function that serves as a new event.listener
  ![Javascript validator code clear](assets/readme-images/javascript-validator.png)


### Accessibility

#### 1. Lighthouse testing

Light house in Chrome Dev tools was used to confirm accessibility of the site and confirm that the colors of the site are easy to read.

![Lighthouse report results](assets/readme-images/lighthouse-report.png)

#### 2. Semantic HTML

Ensured all HTML elements had appropriate semantic meaning for accessibility.

#### 3. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

ARIA attributes were utilised on links to enhance the accessibility of the site allowing for screen readers to accurately pick up information.

#### 4. Contrast and Readability

[Coolers Contrast Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) was used to ensure  sufficient contrast in colors chosen to make the content readable for users with visual impairments.

#### 5. Alt Text for Images

All images on the website include descriptive alternative text (alt text). This helps users with visual impairments understand the content and context of images even if they cannot see them.

#### 6. Responsive Design

The website is responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. This benefits users with different abilities and ensures a consistent and accessible user experience.

This was tested via [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) as the project progressed.

### Code

- I used [The Web Shala's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8QbjXdVl9c&ab_channel=TheWebShala) YouTube tutorial for inspiration for using hide classes and keeping all the html in one document.
- I used [Game Dev Academy](https://gamedevacademy.org/javascript-docstrings-tutorial/) tutorial on docstrings to help master the labelling of my javascript. Especially for the docstring of my CheckAnswer function
- I used [Free Code Camps](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/innerhtml-vs-innertext-vs-textcontent/) article to determine what was best to use to update text content in my javascript.
- For README.md file, reference from my first project was considered.
